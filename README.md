# Spotify-app
This Shiny app analyses your (long-term and short-term) Spotify behavior and proposes new songs.

To use this app you need to create a Client-ID and Client Secret here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications. Provide these details in the R-code, to start analysing your Spotify behavior and get recommendations!
